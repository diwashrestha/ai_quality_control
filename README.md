# ai_quality_control
This project implements a Steel Defect Detection System using a UNet model for image segmentation. The system is designed to detect and classify defects in steel images, aiding in quality control and inspection processes. It utilizes the PyTorch framework for deep learning and Streamlit for the user interface.
